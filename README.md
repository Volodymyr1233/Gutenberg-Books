This is my "Gutenberg Books" library build on React using TypeScript, React Router and <a href="https://gutendex.com/">Gutendex API</a>

🧑‍💻Functionality:

✅ App gets data (100 books) from our API and shows it beautifully to user
✅ User can find specific book with search bar in all books section and also in favourite books section
✅ If user likes the book he can add it to favourite section and also remove it from this section
✅ User can directly read every book on the page
Hope you enjoy my project🙌
